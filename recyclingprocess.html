    <h2>Plastic waste recycling : </h2>
    
    <p><b>
               The recycling process of turning waste plastic into new products involves several key steps:</b></p>
        
               <p><b>1.Collection: Plastic waste is collected from homes, businesses, and recycling centers. This can be done through curbside collection programs or designated drop-off points.</b></p>
        
               <p><b>2.Sorting: The collected plastic is sorted based on type and color. This is often done using machines that can identify different types of plastic, such as PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and HDPE (high-density polyethylene).</b></p>
        
               <p><b>3.Washing and Cleaning: The sorted plastic is washed to remove any contaminants, such as food residue, labels, and adhesives. This ensures that the plastic is clean and ready for processing.</b></p>
        
               <p><b>4.Shredding/Grinding: The clean plastic is then shredded into small pieces or flakes. This makes it easier to handle and process further.</b></p>
        
               <p><b>5.Identification and Separation: The shredded plastic is further sorted to ensure that only one type of plastic is processed together. This step is crucial for maintaining the quality of the recycled plastic.</b></p>
        
               <p><b>6.Compounding: The sorted plastic flakes are melted and formed into pellets or granules. These pellets can then be used to manufacture new plastic products.</b></p>
        
               <p><b>7.Extrusion: The pellets are melted and extruded into new products, such as bottles, containers, or other plastic items.</b></p>
        
               <p><b>8.Quality Control: The final products are inspected to ensure they meet quality standards and are ready for distribution and use.</b></p>
